## Codibly Tech Task

##### PHP 8.0 && Symfony 5.2 <3
This is an small example that PHP 8.0 doesn't have any `children fevers`.
The most problematic is migrating existing source code PHP < 7.4 to 8.0.
The complexity of migration is bigger when it contains a lot more of code.
Impossible is nothing.

### Requirements
Write applications using Symfony 4+
In which you will use the Messenger component to handle such tasks:
- product creation
- product edition
- downloading the list of products
- single product download
  Put these rest actions in a single controller, eg ProductController
  Use "messageBus" to extract logic from the controller and handle it according to the standards that Messenger enforces.
  The application does not have to have any interface, we do not need a docker, we are interested in the code of the Symphonic application itself.
  Write tests for warrants using phpunit.

### Example cURLs
##### POST
curl -X POST -v localhost:8080/api/product -d "name=productName" -d "price=123"

##### GET
curl -X GET -v localhost:8080/api/product/1

##### PUT
curl -X PUT -v localhost:8080/api/product/1 -d "name=newProductName" -d "price=321"

##### GET list
curl -X GET -v localhost:8080/api/products?name=productName

##### Running Unit Tests (inside container)
composer phpunit
